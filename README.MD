## About us!

This is the new repository and host for the RamWorks docs (HD+, Ram Networks, LMN, etc). The school district in which RamWorks is located at have closed the ability to share Google docs with anyone outside of the district.

Main releases will be posted in the Releases tab, so make sure to filter them with the tags.

RamWorks projects less frequently updated will be posted in the main branch. Small updates or announcements may be posted in the readme.

Maybe some other projects will start their own repositories, so this one will be strictly Ram Networks. If you own a project, please do this!


## About The Creators!

Yesn't: Co-Founder and Co-Owner of RamWorks Development Group!

theshmunguss1: Founder and Owner of RamWorks Development Group!

## What We're Up To!

I (Yesn't) Am currently taking a javascript coding course in order to possibly make a site hosted right here on GitHub!
I'm also working on coding an HTML version of Undertale, A PSP emulator, and some Newsletters for Ramworks!
